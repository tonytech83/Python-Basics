The course "Python Web Basics" will lay the foundations of Web programming with Python and Django. It will look at how networks actually work, what HTTP is, and what the basic principles of web development are. You will learn to work with databases and write basic SQL queries using pgAdmin. The course will examine the main concepts in the MTV (Model–Template–View) architecture, and in addition to them, forms (Form and ModelForm) will be used for application development, media files will be worked with, and data will be stored in PostgreSQL. The training includes practical laboratory exercises (labs) and workshops for building complete, fully functional Django web applications.
